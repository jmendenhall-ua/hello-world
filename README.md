This repository is for GIST604B Spring 2025. 

My name is Jacqueline, I did my undergrad in Geology at Western Washington University and graduated in 2016. 
I've been working as a Geo for the past 7 years and have gotten to work in a lot of cool places. I think working in the Brooks Range in Alaska was my favorite, 
and Timmins, Ontario, Canada was my second favorite.
